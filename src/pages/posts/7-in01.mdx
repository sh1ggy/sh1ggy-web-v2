I majored in Computer Science with minors in Engineering Foundations and Mobile Applications and graudated with honours. Despite learning a lot at Queensland University of Technology, my most valuable experiences came from my last three semesters in the course which involved a Capstone Project and CAB403. All other units that I did were good stepping stones to these experiences however. This degree has given me a good opportunity and drive to improve my programming and communication skills. In this article I will be highlighting which units I have gotten the most out of and what I learnt from them.

## Subject Highlights	

### IFB398 & IFB399 (Capstone Project): `2020 - 2021`
---
This project, done in **TypeScript**, **React** & **React Native**, required the most thorough use of my programming, communication and organisational skills to date and I think that it is an important reason as to why I'm even creating this website in the first place. The Redland Museum DIGS project or [`RMDIGS`](/posts/8-rmdigs) for short as it's known was worth it's own article so make sure to read it there. 

### CAB403 (Systems Programming): `2021`

I've written a whole article as to why this **C** subject was one that I would wholeheartedly recommend, so I'll redirect you there [`CAB403`](/posts/6-cab403). In summary, I learnt a lot about fundamental programming axioms and it contributed to a deeper knowledge after being challenged by a large and complex project.

### CAB210 (User Experience Fundamentals): `2021`

This unit represents my interest in user experience and design and I rate it highly because you get to work with real clients which definitely helps to make the university work you're doing tangible. This subject involved a group presentation, report and a solo-produced video all of which focussed on a company that was seeking feedback for their website design. We made thorough use of testing methodologies and gathered data on our own to be evaluated in a report format. Structuring user testing methodologies and processing that raw data into understandable trends is the most valuable thing I learnt from the unit and is something that I hope to employ in future projects if possible. Organising a large amount of raw data required a lot of group communication and team work to make sure that we were all on the same page.

### IAB207 (Rapid Web Development): `2021`

[`Wesbite`](https://iab207-eventfest.herokuapp.com/)

CSS-Bootstrap, Python (Flask) and JQuery were focus of this unit where, in a team of four, I would produce an event-booking website with a login system (without authentication) and user-created content. This unit helped me to bring it back a little and kind of learn web development basics which definitely helped me to re-tune my programming skills a little. In a team of four, collaboration felt a bit cramped and so my role wasn't all too pronounced and it was mostly suggesting ideas and checking through other's code so as not to step on their toes. We mainly stuck to VSC Live Share collaboration where all four of us would be coding at the same time, this did make it easier for all of us to be on the same page but wasn't really representative of a true version-controlled and collaborative experience. Using Heroku to deploy the website was fun though as we faced a challenge where we had incompatible package versions between Postgres and SQLAlchemy (which is what we were using) and a few other packages. Overall, a solid unit to hone web development fundamentals but nothing more.

### CAB302 (Software Development): `2019`

[`report.pdf`](/blog/IN01/cab302report.pdf)

Done in **Java**, this was the first unit that necessitated the use of GitHub where the project was to create a billboard system in Java Swing. This project, the Electronic Billboard Display and Management System, involved authentication, user management, a server, front end control panel for admins as well as a front end displaying billboards. Users could create and schedule billboards to be displayed at certain times in the day as well as customise what they looked like. 

I learnt the fundamentals of GitHub as well as how to structure a psuedo-stacked application. Additionally, using Java was a good way to get comfortable with object orientated programming as we had to set up classes and scope them appropriately. This subject had a good amount of challenge to it and I think that it's definitely worth doing.

### CAB230 (Web Computing): `2019`
[`repo`](https://github.com/sh1ggy/cab202-tomandjerry)

Done in **ReactJS**, this unit acted as my introduction to web computing and it was definitely a challenge for me personally. There was a front-end component that had us retrieve data from a pre-built API and a back-end component which required us to create end points, both of which were two separate assessments. The unit had little amounts of guidance so there was a lot of figuring out what to do and it ended up being my first real challenge in the degree as well as being a spark for my interest in web computing. Despite not getting good grades for this personally, I would recommend doing this unit if you are interested in web computing, especially because ReactJS is a fun and widespread framework to learn. 

### CAB202 (Microprocessors & Digital System): `2019`

This is a very fun unit because of the fact that you're making a game in C, one in the terminal and one on a piece of hardware. It taught me a lot about array manipulation as well as being a good introduction to using the terminal. Compiling C programs was also a novel experience for me at this time so it definitely felt like I was learning a lot at once. Tough debugging added to the challenge of doing this unit and it was the precursor to me enjoying CAB403 so much I think. Highly recommend. 

## Conclusion
Ultimately, university built my programming toolkit up to the point where I think I could learn on my own now and where I hope to move on to more ambitious solo and group projects outside of my comfort zone. I do wish that I drove myself to do more outside of university but doing all of these units has brought my level of confidence and work ethic to a high enough level that I can be self-sufficient. I hope to continue learning and growing as a programmer for as long as I can.
