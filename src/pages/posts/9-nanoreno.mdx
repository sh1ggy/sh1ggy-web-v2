NaNoReNo is a month-long annual visual novel game jam that has been running since 2015 and has slowly come to be one of the largest visual novel game jams on itch.io. The game jam itself had absolutely no restrictions other than it being a visual novel, which made it quite difficult to brainstorm. 

Visual novels have always intrigued me because of its ability to aggregate different the creative fields of programming, art, music and story into one single project. For this game jam, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and form a team by myself rather than coming into it with a pre-established team. Despite this, I ended up bringing my friends into it because of a lack of participation from my first team. I wanted to come out of this jam learning a new technology and gaining some new skills as well as participating with others with similar motivations. 

## Timeline

### Failed Team (VamPy)
The first team that I joined looked very promising with everyone excelling in their respective fields, I honestly felt quite intimidated, giving me a good dose of imposter syndrome. Despite these doubts, things went along, with the team organising meeting times around timezones and work schedules. The concept itself was a vampire-based visual novel that would have the main character deal with turning into one, with the player choosing how to handle the character's transformation via how they interact with others. The concept sounded a bit generic but I was interested to the see how it would go. 

As the weeks went on, the team meetings that we had all organised to make time for slowly devolved into excessive waffling between team members with no tasks being actually completed. A few team members would change their minds on their commitment to the game jam and some would join and leave, the main absence was the artist, literally sending 3 responses total by the end of it. This team was honestly just too nice to each other, not really making anyone do any work or setting any deadlines. Slowly these meetings died down over the month which was incredibly disappointing considering that the portfolios of the writer, artist and musician were very strong. I was interested in being able to being all of the elements together in the end. Toward the tail end of the slow death of this team, I ended up asking the musician, Bismii (the one I was the most familiar communicating with) if he wanted to just form a different team entirely and go from there. Bismii was the only one to actually produce any content that I could worth it because without a motivated character artist or writer, my role was pretty much in stasis. It felt a bit pointless for me to be randomly designing game mechanics if I didn't even have view into a clear creative or artistic vision. Anyways, bringing 2 friends in and the aforementioned Bismii, we formed a new team and conceptualised the visual novel "**When?**"

### When?
At this stage there were only **9 days** left for the game jam which is inclusive of the time to develop a concept, gather assets, decide on music and program the game. The first three days were spend building the concept and general vision of the game. After some time spent brainstorming, we decided on going with a serious story that had the main character coming to terms with his terminal illness and deciding that he needs to spend his valuable time in a more meaningful way. Looking back on it, going for a more relaxed concept probably would have been more fun to create for all of us but nonetheless we decided on this idea. The format that this would be presented in was a **kinetic visual novel**, which is a linear visual novel with no decisions or branching paths, because of its simplicity and our limited time.

The UI design, programming and assembling of the whole game happened in approximately 5 days and honestly wasn't that hard, it felt like I was editing a video rather than actually solving programming problems. A lot of time was spent learning and creating assets for the game's GUI and backgrounds to ensure that the visuals were able to play well together. The programming basically involved putting everything together, adding every element in linearly and with appropriate transitions between sprites, backgrounds, music and sound effects. The artist, musician and writer definitely pulled their weight, producing content very quickly and suitably. For having produced **When?** in the short time period that we did, this game jam was a personal success for me and my team especially because you wouldn't have been able to tell how rushed the production was. Though I wonder what would have been possible given a full month's worth of breathing room. 

After the game had been submitted I did an interview with a streamer to break down the process and see my team's game played to an audience. They enjoyed the game as far as I could tell, not being able to tell that the production was rushed in 9 days which was incredibly gratifying to hear. 


## Summary
### Things Learned
- Make quick decisions about switching teams after seeing their level of commitment
- Set harsher deadlines and don't waste time being too nice to each other, it is a game jam after all
- Participate in game jams and hackathons to have fun  and learn rather than make something profound, more often than not, something unique and fun will capture an audience in these events
- Ren'Py is simple, the only complicated thing being fancy transitions (though we did stick with a simple visual novel format so I didn't get to utilise Ren'Py's full potential)

### Conclusion
I'm glad to have participated in a game jam that required all of the major fields of art to be involved and see them all click together. It was a very unique experience and I would want to see what my team could do with a less serious concept driving the game. I am very interested in utilising Ren'Py to produce a game with branching paths and complicated flag logic so I'm definitely looking forward to the next time I get to participate in a visual novel game jam.
