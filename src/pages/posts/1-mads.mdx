This was the first hackathon that I personally participated in and this blog post will serve to be a reflection of what I took away from the event in terms of teamwork and programming skills. 

The goal of this hackathon was to choose a start-up that our team, TDRJKM, was most interested in and bring their vision to life in the form of an app and overall presentation of its functionality within 3 days. We chose a start-up called Casual Earnings that wanted to create a self-managed work rostering mobile platform with features including a social network of other contract workers, hourly pay calculator and a shift calendar. 

I entered with a team of friends, only one of which had any programming background so there was a lot of uncertainty with the roles that everyone was going to take on. There was another person that joined our team after the fact because of vested interest in the start-up that we chose. 

**Role -** During this hackathon I was able to dip my toes in project management as I had essentially brought most of the team in and so I felt as though it was my job to try and coordinate everyone's skills together and distribute tasks. Alongside trying to communicate with all my team members well I was trying to also program my section of the project however, under the pressure of the hackathon I found it hard to manage both the responsibilities of my team members and my own. 

## Skills Learned
### Rapid App Design & Development
- *Design* - Adobe XD
- *Development* - Android Studio (& XCode) 

Low fidelity designs were quickly produced so that development could begin. The design team then moved on to high fidelity designs to be exported and used in Android Studio.

### Adobe XD Mock-Ups

The development process was very slow because of my inexperience with both Github collaboration and mobile app development using Android Studio. My main tasks were the organisation of the designed elements in Android Studio and a timer feature present within the app to clock into a shift for example. 

The functionality was also split because our other team member developed the hourly wage calculator in XCode. 

 - **Teamwork**: There was a large distance in skillsets, so it was hard to unify the app's direction. There were a lot of communication breakdowns and a lot of moments were spent brainstorming together in order to clarify both the app's visual direction and what functionality to include. 
 

 - **Dealing with Pressure**: The combination of my friends' expectations during the event and the short time frame allowed me to learn about my personal stress limit and how to mitigate it as much as I could. 


## Conclusion

Ultimately, what ended up being presented was more of a vision brought to life in the form of high fidelity mock-ups for what Casual Earnings wanted to see, as the application itself. To our surprise, our team, TDRJKM, won second place in the end because the start-up thought that it was a good enough first step for the direction that they wanted to go in. 

Obtaining this result taught me that the goal of these hackathons should be to have fun and learn. Too much personal stress will only detract from your experience and it's what I hoped to bring to future hackathons.
