This website was designed by me and acts as a programming portfolio, showcasing my professional experience, projects as well as showcasing any other noteworthy projects. This is a revamp of my original website & blog [sh1ggy-web](https://github.com/sh1ggy/sh1ggy-web) as my front-end skills have improved.

The website itself is still currently a work in progress. 

## Getting Started
